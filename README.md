Image Projection with Banner
This project demonstrates the process of overlaying a banner on the right facade of a building based on 3D coordinates and a camera projection matrix. The script uses Python with OpenCV, NumPy, and Tesseract for Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

Overview
The goal of this project is to take an input image of a building, apply a banner at specified 3D coordinates, and display the resulting image with the banner on the right facade. This involves the use of a camera projection matrix, 3D scan data, and OCR to determine the exact coordinates for banner placement.

Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV
NumPy
Tesseract OCR
Install the required libraries using:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python numpy pytesseract
Ensure that Tesseract OCR is installed on your system. You can download it from Tesseract OCR.

Usage
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/uv-eye-project.git
cd project
Upload Files to Colab:

If you are using Google Colab, upload the necessary files (projMat.txt, 3d_scan.txt, image.jpg, banner.jpg, coordinated.png) using the appropriate Colab cell.

Run the Script:

Execute the main script in a Python environment:

bash
Copy code
python uv_eye_project.py
This script reads the projection matrix, scans 3D coordinates, projects them onto the 2D image, and overlays the banner on the right facade.

Review Results:

The script displays the right facade with the added banner. Adjustments can be made to the script as needed.

Explanation of Script
Reading Projection Matrix:
Reads the camera projection matrix from the projMat.txt file.

3D to 2D Projection:
Projects 3D coordinates from the 3d_scan.txt file onto the 2D image using the camera projection matrix.

OCR for Coordinates:
Uses Tesseract OCR on the coordinated.png image to extract text containing 3D coordinates.

Banner Overlay:
Resizes the banner image based on OCR-detected coordinates and overlays it onto the right facade.

Display Result:
Displays the resulting image with the added banner on the right facade.
